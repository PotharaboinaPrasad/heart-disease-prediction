Heart Disease Prediction using Neural Networks
Overview
This project implements a heart disease prediction model using neural networks. The model is trained on a dataset containing medical attributes and aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on input parameters.

Features
Data preprocessing and normalization

Neural network model implementation

Training and evaluation of the model

Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Interactive visualization of results (if applicable)

Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow/Keras

Scikit-learn

Pandas & NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
cd heart-disease-prediction
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The model is trained using the UCI Heart Disease Dataset or any other relevant dataset. Ensure the dataset is placed in the appropriate directory before training the model.

Usage
Run the data preprocessing script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python preprocess.py
Train the model:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train.py
Evaluate the model:

bash
Copy
Edit
python evaluate.py
(Optional) Run the prediction script for new inputs:

bash
Copy
Edit
python predict.py --input "age,cholesterol,blood_pressure,..."
Model Performance
